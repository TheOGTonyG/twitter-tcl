  - Don't show any tweets on first update after authenticating. Just track
    the latest ID then show new ones after that.
  - add check for change in twitter followers periodically (daily?)
  - add `twit_status` to show account currently on
  - add block
  - `twit_info` to see info of a screen name (bio, real name, site, etc)
  - do the sorting of params (see `oauth.tcl`, marked TODO there)
